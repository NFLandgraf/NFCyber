-Watch out that the .csv file and the corresponding video file have the same beginning (e.g. animal name) and 
that the video file end with either '_labeled' or 'YLineMasked'
-Open YLine_prep.py
-Run the first cell (IMPORT)
-Run the second cell (USER INPUT) and change the values of the arena corners until the Y maze is perfectly matched and copy the respective lines 
into YLine_Analy.py
-Run YLine_Analy.py and enkoy the .txt file and the video file for further steps
